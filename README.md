NODE JS / 42 school projet - Web

This is a team project. We built a torrent streaming website with a restful api using angular 4 and nodejs.

We used 2 sources for torrents : 
- 1 for movies (yts api).
- 1 for series (eztv through popcorn time api).

We used mongodb for database.

I worked moslty on nodejs side.
